Project Details
Project Title: HamroAwaj
Category: E-Goverence
Problem Statement: Many citizens face problems like damaged roads, waste issues, water shortages, or streetlight failures but do not know the proper way to report them. Even when complaints are made, there is often no tracking system, leading to delays or no response from authorities. This lack of communication and transparency makes city services slow, inefficient, and frustrating for the public.

Solution Overview: The solution is a digital platform that allows citizens to easily report city-related problems by selecting the issue category, adding location details, and uploading photos if needed. Once submitted, the complaint is sent to the concerned department, where authorities can view, manage, and update its status. Users can track the progress of their complaint in real time, which improves transparency, speeds up response, and creates better communication between citizens and city authorities.
